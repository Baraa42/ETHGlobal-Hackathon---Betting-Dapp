# ETHGlobal-Hackathon---Betting-Dapp
## Sports Betting Dapp

The idea of the project would be to create a sports exchange betting Dapp between players (similar to how Betfair exchange works).
Additionaly create a Sports Betting Protocol similar to how Synthetix works : Players bet against the protocol, and users can stake their BET token to earn protocol rewards.


### Projet task :
 - Create simple markets for one mainstream competition. For example, allowing users to bet on the simple result ( Win/Draw/Lose ) for Premier league games. 
 - Allow Users to make bids and asks for the game and choose odds they wish to bet on, hence no need for the protocol to set the odds and only settle the bet result.
- When the game ends, bets will be paid off by the smart contract who should receive the game result from some oracle.
- Charge low commission that goes to some treasury DAO?


### Advanced/Long term vision : 
- Make more markets available.
- Fetch odds from bookmakers and make odds suggestions for players.
- Launch the exchange for live betting
- Launch a decentralized betting platform (maybe inspired from Synthetix model) where users bet against the protocol : 
                <br/> -  The protocol fetches odds from different bookmakers and then make its odds for the game.
                <br/> - Players can bet against the protocol odds ( obviously will have to take some low commission on bets)
               <br/> -  Players can also stake their BET token and earn a share of protocol revenue.
